A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.<br><br>

A Binary Tree node contains following parts:-
1.Data
2.Pointer to left child
3.Pointer to right child
<br>
All important thing that we can do with Tree is included in this code.<br>
I have created function of everything  and commented above every function just for ease to you readers <br>
